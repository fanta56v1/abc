File naming (recommended):
- A.mp3, B.mp3, …, Z.mp3 (26 files)
- Use lowercase or other names? Use uppercase A–Z exactly to match the code.

Format tips:
- mp3 at 44.1 kHz, mono is sufficient; keep each clip around 0.3–0.8 seconds.
- Trim leading/trailing silence so playback feels snappy for kids.
- Peak normalize to around −1 dBFS for consistent loudness.

Recording suggestions:
- Speak clearly with a friendly tone: “A”, “B”, … “Z”.
- Use a phone voice memo in a quiet room -> export as mp3.
- Free editors like Audacity can trim and export.

Multiple formats:
- The app prefers mp3. If your browser struggles with mp3, you can record m4a/ogg/wav and rename files accordingly, but keep the A–Z names and the same extension for all letters.

Test:
- Open index.html and click “读一读”或“再念一次”。
- If a letter has no matching file, the app automatically falls back to TTS.
